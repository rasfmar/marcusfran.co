                <p>I specialize in web design and web application development, so most of my skills are concentrated around HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have experience in front-end JavaScript/CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap 4 and Angular (which uses TypeScript), which this site was created with, as well as front-end animations with libraries such as Anime.js, p5.js, and CSS keyframes/transitions. I have lots of experience in other JavaScript-based applications such as Node.js, libraries such as E.js and Express.js. This site was deployed using an AWS instance, Git, and Docker, all of which I use frequently.</p>
                <p>In terms of software engineering, I have recently dabbled in mobile application development with Swift, competitive programming with C++17, machine learning with Python3, operating system development in x86 Intel machine language, and reverse engineering. Through over a decade, I have acquired the fundamentals behind other languages such as Lua, Java, and Visual Basic.</p>
                <p>I've also recently become versed in basic UI/UX design using Adobe XD mockups/prototyping. However, my skills are focused more on execution instead.</p>
